NOTE:

I have removed all formal git tags. This is OK. I am going to do the same in
the PICOS repo (and all other repos as the occasion arises). I suggest that
we stop formal tagging (tags are a bit troublesome, because they have to be
pushed separately and get in the way of something every once in a while).

This doesn't mean that we don't want to use our "internal" tags, like
PG170720A. We can use them and put them into RTAGS and commit messages. They
are fine, except that they won't identify commits directly.

To see the commits corresponding to our internal tags execute:

	git log > rtags.txt

You will see there a list of commit messages looking (for example) like this:

commit e56633882a23978ea8c5c52445c1138ab0130e77
Author: Pawel Gburzynski <pawel@olsonet.com>
Date:   Sun Jun 18 20:05:34 2017 +0200

    PG170618A:
    
    I have cleaned up the VUEE data sets in locaspot. Also, I have improved
    (and brought up to date) the Bezannes model (bezannes.xml). The channel
    model is much better (closer to the real thing) than the previous
    version. I am going to try to bring it even closer, so I have something
    to test (with a reasonable reliability) future modifications to the
    location server.

The SHA1 sum in the "commit" line identifies the commit. An initial unique
sequence will do, e.g., here is the command to look at the version of some
file as per PG170618A:

	git show e56633882:DATAFILES/bezannes_cases.txt > old_content.txt

Note that git log basically replicates RTAGS this way. As long as we put the
internal tag id into a commit message, we are safe without using formal (git)
tags.
